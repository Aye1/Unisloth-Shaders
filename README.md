Unity package with some useful shaders

## 2D shaders
### Sprite Outline
Creates a pixel perfect outline around a sprite.
As this shader is based on differences of translations of the sprite, be sure not to put an outline thickness too big.

It may not work either with sprites with really complex shapes if you put a thickness too big.
